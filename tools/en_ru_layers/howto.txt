Download QMK Msys from here https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_getting_started and install,
From within its terminal (mingw64.exe), run: 
qmk setup
It will create a huge git repository somewhere in C:\Users\Username\qmk_firmware (by default).

In C:\Users\Username\qmk_firmware\keyboards\moonlander\keymaps create a folder with your layout 
name and put sources downloaded from Oryx there (config.h, keymap.c and rules.mk)
Could probably already build against the "default" firmware with
qmk compile -kb moonlander -km layout_name
but some things may not work

To use zsa firmware instead of default firmware:
(based on the instructions from here: https://github.com/zsa/qmk_firmware/)
git remote add zsa https://github.com/zsa/qmk_firmware.git
git fetch --all
Then it says to check out zsa/master, but I couldn't find that there,
so I checked out zsa/firmware_20 instead.

In Msys terminal, make sure you're in 'qmk_firmware'
Run:
make git-submodule

Now you can probably build your layout with
make moonlander:layout_name
as well as with
qmk compile -kb moonlander -km layout_name
It will create C:\Users\Username\qmk_firmware\.build\moonlander_layout_name.bin,
which can be flashed to the keyboard with Wally.
